note over browser:
User clicks save button, which
has been bound to an anonymous function
when spa.js was run.
The function creates a JS object of the form
{content: "content",
date: new Date}
end note

browser->browser: Create JS object with new content
browser->browser: Push new content to notes array
browser->browser: Call redrawNotes to update DOM
browser->server: HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
server->browser: Response message
browser->browser: Write server message to console

note over browser:
Please note that the above flow has a big flaw:
If the server returns an error and is not able
to save the new note, there will be an <bold>inconsistency</bold>
between what is actually drawn on the screen and what
is saved on the server
